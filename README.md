## Overview
This example app includes a mobile application powered by React Native and Expo

This application demonstrates a mobile friendly signup and sign in flow powered by Stytch. In this example the following Stytch products are used:
1. [SMS passcodes](https://stytch.com/products/sms-passcodes)
2. [Session management](https://stytch.com/products/session-management)

## Running locally

**Create a Stytch account**

First you will need to sign up and create a new project in [Stytch](https://stytch.com/). Then run the following commands in the terminal of your choice.

**Stytch Dashboard Configuration**

You'll need to take some steps in the [Stytch Dashboard SDK Configuration](https://stytch.com/dashboard/sdk-configuration) in order to enable your project to use the SDK.

1. Enable SDK for your project
2. Add `stytch.rn.test` as a Bundle ID
3. Enable SMS Passcodes (OTP)

**Install Expo**
```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
```

**Clone repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-expo-integration.git
cd stytch-expo-integration
```

Next we need to create a `.env` file to store our API keys. Modify and run the command below to create a `.env` file using the API keys found in your Stytch [project dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/api-keys).
```bash
# in ./stytch-expo-integration/client
echo "STYTCH_PUBLIC_TOKEN=GET_FROM_STYTCH_DASHBOARD" > .env
```

**Start Expo**
```bash
cd client
npm install
expo start


You should now have Expo running on your machine. You can now use the Expo CLI tooling to open the mobile application in a simulator or as a web application.
