# Stytch + Expo example app

## Overview
This example app includes two services:
1. A mobile application powered by React Native and Expo
2. An Express/Node server which wraps the Stytch API

WIP

### What is the purpose of the Express/Node server?
It is generally accepted that sensative keys such an API secrets should not be stored client side. For that reason, the client application communcates with the Express/Node server, and the server interacts with the Stytch API. This architecture keeps all sensative keys off the user's device.
